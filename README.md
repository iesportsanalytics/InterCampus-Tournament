# InterCampus-Tournament

## Project Description

The InterCampus Tournament is a great opportunity for IE to create a stronger sense of community by connecting both campuses. The Sports and Well Being department have created this friendly competition for people to get to know eachother and have a good time while being active and staying healthy. The IE Sports Analytics Club has also seen this an an opportunity to create a project where people interested in the field of Sports Analytics can get a chance to gain hands-on experience.

### The Goals (pun intended)
The goal of this project is to create a model for object detection and data collection, while helping people gain experience where it would otherwise be difficult. 

Sports to be involved (only ones we will work on).
