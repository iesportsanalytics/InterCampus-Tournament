# InterCampus-Tournament + Spots Analytics Club

## Project Description

The **InterCampus Tournament** is a great opportunity for IE to create a stronger sense of community by connecting both campuses. The **Sports and Well Being** department have created this friendly competition for people to get to know eachother and have a good time while being active and staying healthy. The **IE Sports Analytics Club** has also seen this an an opportunity to create a project where people interested in the field of Sports Analytics can get a chance to gain hands-on experience. Through this tournament, participants will engage in various sports, each serving as a canvas for our analytical projects.

### The Goal (pun intended)
The goal of this project is to create a model for **object detection** and **data collection**, tailored to the amateur sports enviornmment. More than just data and analytics, it is also important to the Sports Analytics Club to create a **learning ecosystem**, helping people gain experience where it would otherwise be difficult. The initiative aims to democratize the field of sports analytics, providing a ground for experimentation, learning, and professional growth.

## Sports Involved

Since most people that signed up to work on the project chose **football** and/or **basketball**, these will be the two sports which we will focus on. Volleyball was a less popular choice, but it can still be included in the project.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Recording the football and basketball (and potentially volleyball) games played during the InterCampus Tournament.

2. **Model Development**:

- *Object Detection*: Using yolov5 or yolov8 from ultralytics to train object detection models. Train and apply the models to the recorded games.
- *Data Analysis Models*: Building models to analyze player performance, predict game outcomes, and uncover insights into team strategies.

3. **Implementation**: Applying the models to the last games of the tournament to collect data and provide analytics.

4. **Analysis and Reporting**: Analyzing the collected data to share insights into the tournament that all students, not just those participating, can enjoy and find interesting.


## Technologies Involved

The project will involve the following technologies:

- **Python**: Modules used will likley include Pandas, Numpy, Ultralytics, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **Physical Cameras**: Used to record the games.
